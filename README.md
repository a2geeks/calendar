Event Notification Automation For A2Geeks.

This repo will contain scripts which take data from the events@a2geeks.org calendar and push it to various targetted publishing platforms. 

For example, daily tweets of what's happening today, Tumblr posts of the week's events, perhaps a weekly email roundup of events. 

The idea is we can curate events into a single google calendar as we find them with all the required data, and the notifications go out at appropriate times relative to the events without human interaction.
